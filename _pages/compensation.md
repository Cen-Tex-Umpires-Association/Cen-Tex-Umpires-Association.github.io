Unlike some chapters, CenTex does not deduct fees from member earnings for assigning, game pay sheets, or payment processing — **you keep 100% of your game and travel fees**. Chapter operations are funded through scrimmage proceeds and member dues.

Our Member-at-Large handles all paysheet submissions, so you never need to contact schools about game pay sheets or payments.

## Travel Fees for 2026
> Centerpoint: 1202 S Main St, Georgetown, TX 78626

Travel fees are based on the distance from the chapter centerpoint to the venue. Officials receive one travel fee per venue per day, regardless of how many games are worked.

- $20 for 0-30.9 Miles (_Majority of our schools_)
- $35 for 31-60.9 Miles (_Elgin, Marble Falls, & St. Michael's_)
- $50 for 61-90.9 Miles
- Portal-to-Portal round trip at 0.72/mi for venues exceeding 91 miles one-way from chapter centerpoint

## Game Fees for 2026
Tournament, regular season, and playoff games fees are established by TASO for all UIL and TAPPS games our chapter covers.
